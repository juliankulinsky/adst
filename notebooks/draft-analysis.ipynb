    "### 1.1 Future licenses for Netflix to gain competitive advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "Highly impacted by COVID, direct-to-customer entertainment services drastically shaped the movie and entertainment industry. Disney, Netflix, Amazon, just to name a few, are highly invested in expanding their movies and series selection to compete for the trust and loyalty of customers. Therefore, they not only increased their selection in buying licenses for existing movies and shows, they also spend much money on producing movies and series on their own to provide exclusive content on their corresponding platform. To sum it up, the importance of owning and retaining such intellectual property in perpetuity has also increased among brands as a way to attract and retain customers (Harvard, 2021).\n",
    "With our analytical approach, we want to investigate which movies 1) are likely to provide the best customer experience as possible, 2) have the highest potential of creating a high revenue flow and 3) should be promoted and advertised more to attract customers (if already existing).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction, Disney, Netflix, Amazon and co. are investing heavily in expanding their movie and series offerings to compete for customer trust and loyalty. Literature suggests that content acquisition and retention are critical to maintaining customer loyalty and audience churn towards video-on-demand. Accordingly, this is a timely topic and one that is important to the film and entertainment industry, which is why we chose it for our use case. We want to find out which movies are best suited to retain customer loyalty or attract new customers.\n",

    "    The content of the thesis is to examine the progress that the online television industry has made in recent years from a business and financial perspective. The focus here is particularly on the streaming platform Netflix. It is concluded that content acquisition and retention is critical to maintaining customer loyalty.\n",

    "    This article presents an analysis of the original content of fictional series produced by Netflix. Among other things, it is concluded that the acquisition of licenses and rights to broadcast other content continues to be a decisive factor, even if the data of recent years show a certain decline. Nevertheless, this strategic resource guarantees the superiority of Netflix and favors the migration of the audience towards VOD.\n",
