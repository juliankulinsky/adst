### Peer review team

- Peer review by: Gruppe C 
- Names of team members that participated in this review: Lena Binder, Julian Kulinsky, Sven Ritzmann 

### Goal of the project

- With this feedback, we want to analyze and improve the project of our reviewed team. In an ideal world, this helps them to deliver the best result possible for our assignment (Report).  

### Data

- Please update the data dictionary in a correctly formatted table. At the moment, it is shown as blank code in the .ipynb file.
- Change data description for latitude and longitude. Same description is existing here.
- Please differentiate the relevance of the columns `domestic` and `domestic_False`and `domestic_True`- they are all the same.
- (+) Used `.info()` to show data overview and first impression
- We suggest to use `.describe()` to show general statistics and detect first peculiarities such as outliers and other anomalies.
- Are there any columns that need to be dropped to make the analysis clearer? (In our opinion: yes, such as id and the domestic_False/True, arrest_False/True)
- Descriptive statistics for category variables are missing. This could be also relevant to gain more insights.

### Visualization approach

- _Describe the visualization approaches that will be used._

### Lack of clarity

- Findings: We recommend to provide more insights into your analysis approach: What can you derive from your exploratory analysis? Which features are relevant? Which can be ignored? What does the first look on the statistics indicate? Are there anomalies?
    - We suggest to summarize the findings after each section (at least).
- Hypotheses: Although it is not 100% suitable, but try to formulate more possible hypotheses. The current hypotheses is limited and very general. Try to dive deep and imagine possible outcomes which could lead to a certain call-to-action.

### Possible improvements

- _Provide constructive feedback on how the team might be able to improve their project. Make sure your feedback includes at least one comment on the visualization ideas of the project, but do feel free to comment on aspects beyond visualizations._

### Presentation

- Where do most crimes happen?
- Is there a correlation between seasons, such as winter/sommer? Thinking about it, I would assume there are more crimes in winter due to bad weather, coldness etc.
- Are most crimes falling under the domestic violence act? Why? Why not? What is the domestic violence act?
- Daytime of most crimes across blocks. Are there abnormalities across blocks? Are some blocks more likely for crimes during night? 

### Organization

- _Provide constructive feedback on any issues with file and/or code organization._

### Further comments
