    "### Future licenses for Netflix to gain competitive advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "Highly impacted by COVID, direct-to-customer entertainment services drastically shaped the movie and entertainment industry. Disney, Netflix, Amazon, just to name a few, are highly invested in expanding their movies and series selection to compete for the trust and loyalty of customers. Therefore, they not only increased their selection in buying licenses for existing movies and shows, they also spend much money on producing movies and series on their own to provide exclusive content on their corresponding platform. To sum it up, the importance of owning and retaining such intellectual property in perpetuity has also increased among brands as a way to attract and retain customers (Harvard, 2021).\n",
    "With our analytical approach, we want to investigate which movies 1) are likely to provide the best customer experience as possible measured by i) their directors ii) their featured stars, 2) have the highest potential of creating a high revenue flow and 3) should be promoted and advertised more to attract customers (if already existing).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research question: Which films, stars and genres should Netflix invest in to maintain and expand its market advantage?\n",
    "\n",
    "These include 1) licences for films and actors that Netflix does not yet have in its portfolio and 2) obtaining existing licences as well as promoting and advertising the films and stars that appear in them.\n",
